  ## Description

  A progressive-web-app to keep an account balance even while offline. A user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without an internet connection. As an existing application, my job was to enable off-line functionality by creating and connecting a manifest and a service-worker, and also to deploy to Heroku and connect to a MongoDB database.

  Offline Functionality:

    * Enter deposits offline

    * Enter expenses offline

  When brought back online:

    * Offline entries should be added to tracker.
